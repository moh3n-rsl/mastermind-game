# Mastermind Game

<h3>Rules of the game</h3>

<p>Two players play the game against each other; letâ€™s assume Player 1 and Player 2.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Player 1</strong> plays first by setting a multi-digit number.</li>
<li><strong>Player 2</strong> now tries his first attempt at guessing the number.</li>
<li>If Player 2 succeeds in his first attempt he wins the game and is crowned Mastermind! If not, then Player 1 hints by revealing which digits or numbers Player 2 got correct.</li>
<li>The game continues till Player 2 eventually is able to guess the number entirely.</li>
<li>Now, <strong>Player 2</strong> gets to set the number and Player 1 plays the part of guessing the number.</li>
<li>If Player 1 is able to guess the number within a lesser number of tries than Player 2 took, then Player 1 wins the game and is crowned Mastermind.</li>
<li>If not, then Player 2 wins the game.</li>
</ul>
